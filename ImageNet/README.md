# Variational posterior predictive densities
Herein are a few scripts using the Lasagne and Theano libraries to implement my VPPD ideas and test them against the Bayesian Dark Knowledge, Distillation and maximum likelihood methods of neural net training. Experiments include:
    [x] small datasets
    [] small transfer sets
    [] large transfer set
    [x] large to small networks
